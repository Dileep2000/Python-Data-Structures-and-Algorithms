      What is sorting?
      By defiantion sorting refers to arranging data in particular format: either ascending or descending
      practical use
      Microsoft excel - Built in functionality to sort data
      Online stores: Online shopping websites genreally have option for sorting by rating,price,review etc.

      Types of sorting
      - space used - In place and out place
      - stability - stable and unstable
      Space used
      In place sorting - Sorting alogrithms which doesn't require any extra space for sorting
      - Bubble sort
      out place sorting - sorting alogrithms which require an extra space for sorting
      - merge sort
      Stability
      Stable sorting - If a sorting algorithm after sorting the contents doesn't change the squence of similar content in which they appear, then this sorting is called stable sorting
      - insertion sort
      Unstable sorting - If a sorting algorithm after sorting the content changes the sequence of similar content in which they appear, then this sorting is called unstable sorting
      - Quick sort

      Sorting Terminology
      Increasing order - If successive element is greater than the previous one
      - 1,3,5,7,9,11
      Decreasing order - If successive element is lesser than the previous one
      - 11,9,7,5,3,1
      Non Increasing order - If successive element is less than equal to its previous element in the sequence
      - 11,9,7,5,5,3,1
      Non Decreasing order - If successive element is greater than equal to its previous element in the sequence
      - 1,3,5,5,7,9,11

      Which one of algorithm to select?
      - stability
      - Space efficient
      - Time efficient
