      Quick Sort
      - Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm
      - Find pivot number and make sure samller numbers located at left of pivot and bigger numbers are located at right of pivot
      - unlike merge sort algorithm exta space is not required
      Time O(nLogn) space O(n)
      Quick sort is unstable sorting algorithm
      Quick sort is inn place sorting algorithm

      When to use Quick sort algorithm?
      - When average expected time is O(nlogn)
      when to avoid Quick sort algorithm?
      - When space is a concern
      - when you seed stable sort algorithm
