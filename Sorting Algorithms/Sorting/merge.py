      Merge Sort
      - It is a divide and conquer algorithm
      - Divide the input array in two halves and we keep having recursively untill they become too small that cannot be broken further
      - merge halves by sorting them
      Time O(nlogn) space O(n)
      merge sort is out place alogithm
      merge sort is stable
      when to use merge sort?
      - when you need stable sort
      - when average expexted time in O(NlogN)
      when to avoid stable sort?
      - when space is a concern
