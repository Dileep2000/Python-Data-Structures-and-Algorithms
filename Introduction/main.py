        What are Data structures?
        Data structures are diffrent ways of organizingdata on your computer, that can be used effectively
        What is an algorithm?
        Set of steps to accomplish a task
        A set of rules for a computer program to accomplish a task
        input Data -> Calculation -> Stop when answer found
        What makes a good algorithm?
        1. Correctness
        2. Efficiency
        Why data structures and algorithms are important?
        Data Processing
        input Data -> Processing -> Output
        Data might be of any type, So data structures organize the data and algorithms processes them.
        Problem solving skils
        Fundamental concepts of programming in limited time
        Types of Data structures
        Primitive Data structures and Non-primitive Data structures
        Primitive - Integers, Float, Characters, String and Boolean
        Non Primitive - Derived from combining 1 or more primitive Data structures
        Divided into two - Linear and Non Linear
        Linear - Static(Memory Location is Fixed) and Dynamic(Memory Location is changed)
        Static - Array
        Dynamic- Linked Lists, Stack, queue
        Non Linear - Not organized sequentially - Tree and Graphs
        Each Data structure have its unique properties.

        Diffrent types of Algorithms
        - Simple recursive algorithms
        - Divide and conquer algorithms
        - Dynamic programming algorithms
        - Greedy algorithms
        - Brute Force algorithms
        - Randomized algoriths
